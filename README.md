# 🏛️ Student-Society Enrollment Database

This project is a **MySQL database system** designed to manage **students**, **societies**, and their **enrollments**. It includes schema creation, sample data, 30+ SQL queries, administrative commands, and views to efficiently handle a college's society enrollment process.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Setup Database**
   - Create a new database:  
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE society_management;
     USE society_management;
     ```

2. **Create Schema**
   - Execute `schema.sql` to create the required tables.

3. **Insert Sample Data**
   - Run `sample_data.sql` to populate tables with dummy data.

4. **Explore Queries**
   - Use `queries.sql` to fetch useful insights and manipulate the database.

5. **Admin Operations**
   - Manage users and roles using `admin_commands.sql`.

Would you also like me to give a **fancy version** of this README with **badges** (like "MySQL ✔️", "License 📜", etc.)?  
It will look even cooler on GitHub! 🚀  
Should I? 🎯
